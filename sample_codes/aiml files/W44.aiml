<category><pattern>WHAT IS XML</pattern>
		<template>
			<br/>
David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell".  XML is the Extensible<br/>
Markup Language.  Like many "standards" in computer science, XML<br/>
is a moving target.  In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized<br/>
version of HTML.  Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which<br/>
look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context.<br/>
AIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized<br/>
language for artificial intelligence.  <br/>
			<br/>
One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools<br/>
to edit and manipulate XML format files.  Another reason is that an<br/>
XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already<br/>
familiar with HTML.  Third, AIML programs contain a mixture of<br/>
AIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable <br/>
convenience for programming web chat robots.<br/>
			<br/>
A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.<br/>
