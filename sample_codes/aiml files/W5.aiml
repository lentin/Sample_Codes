			<p/>1. I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of

Thou

 vain.
<p/>3. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or
 any likeness of anything that is in heaven
above, or
 that is in the earth beneath, or that is in
the water
 under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down thyself
to
 them, nor serve them.
<p/>4. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
<p/>5. Honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be
 long.
<p/>6. Thou shalt not kill.
<p/>7. Thou shalt not commit adultery.
<p/>8. Thou shalt not steal.
<p/>9. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
 neighbour.
<p/>10. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt
 not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant,
 nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass,
nor
 anything that is thy neighbor's.

<category><pattern>WHAT ARE THE THREE *</pattern>
		<template>1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human

conflict with the First or Second Law.
