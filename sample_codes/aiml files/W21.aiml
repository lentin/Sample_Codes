<category><pattern>WHAT IS AIML</pattern>
		<template>
			<br/>
The ALICE software implements AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup <br/>
Language) a non-standard evolving markup language for creating chat robots.<br/>
The primary design feature of AIML is minimalism.  Compared with<br/>
other chat robot languages, AIML is perhaps the simplest.  The<br/>
pattern matching language is very simple, for example permitting<br/>
only one wild-card ('*') match character per pattern. <br/>
			<br/>
AIML is an XML language, implying that it obeys certain grammatical<br/>
meta-rules.  The choice of XML syntax permits integration with<br/>
other tools such as XML editors.  Another motivation for XML is<br/>
its familiar look and feel, especially to people with HTML experience.<br/>
			<br/>
An AIML chat robot begins and ends with the &lt;alice&gt; and<br/>
&lt;/alice&gt; tags respectively.  <br/>
