<category><pattern>WHAT IS A TEMPLATE</pattern>
		<template>
			<br/>
A template is the "response" or "output" part of an AIML category.<br/>
			<br/>
The template is the formula for constructing the reply. The simplest<br/>
template consists of plain, unmarked text.  AIML provides markup <br/>
functions to tailor the replies for each individual input and client.  <br/>
The markup function &lt;getname/&gt; for example inserts the client's name <br/>
into the reply. <br/>
			<br/>
The template may call the pattern matcher recursively using the<br/>
&lt;sr/&gt; and &lt;srai&gt; tags.  Many templates are simple symbolic <br/>
reductions that map one sentence form to another, for example<br/>
"Do you know what X is?" transforms to "What is X" with the category<br/>
			<br/>
&lt;category&gt;<br/>
&lt;pattern&gt;DO YOU KNOW WHAT * IS&lt;/pattern&gt;<br/>
&lt;template&gt;&lt;srai&gt;WHAT IS &lt;star/&gt; &lt;/srai&gt;&lt;/template&gt;<br/>
&lt;/category&gt;<br/>
			<br/>
The template may also contain other embedded HTML and XML.  <br/>
These embedded tags may cause the browser to play a sound,<br/>
show an image, or run an applet.  There is considerable freedom<br/>
of expression in the construction of response templates.  The<br/>
botmaster is encouraged to study the examples in ALICE, to and<br/>
experiment with new ideas.<br/>
