<category><pattern>WHAT IS CATEGORY *</pattern>
		<template>Experience with ALICE has allowed us broadly classify three groups of clients:
<ul>
				<li>Category A - Abusive Clients</li>
				<li>Category B - Average Clients</li>
				<li>Category C - Computer experts</li>
			</ul>
Category A clients are the people who say "Fuck you," "You suck", "Suck
my..." and so on. Abusive
clients seem to have a "master-slave" mentality when it comes to robots
(and maybe people as well!).
<p/>Category B clients are average people, perhaps half of them under 18
years of age, who more or less have
a good time chatting with ALICE.
<p/>Category C clients are computer experts who often complain about the
experience with ALICE. They
say it is "old hat", "just like ELIZA", and "nothing new here." 
Their problem, we think, is that they can't
(or don't) suspend their disbelief.  They are like movie critics
watching a film.  We tell them, it doesn't matter,
because we're not doing it for you.  Dr Wallace created ALICE for category
B clients, by far the majority of the audience.
