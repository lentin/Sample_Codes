		<template>
			<br/>
AIML consists of a list of statements called categories.  Each<br/>
category contains an input pattern and a reply template. <br/>
The syntax of an AIML category is:<br/>
			<br/>
&lt;category&gt;<br/>
&lt;pattern&gt; PATTERN &lt;/pattern&gt;  &lt;template&gt; Template &lt;/template&gt;<br/>
&lt;/category&gt;<br/>
			<br/>
or<br/>

&lt;category&gt;<br/>
&lt;pattern&gt; PATTERN &lt;/pattern&gt;<br/>
&lt;that&gt; THAT &lt;/that&gt;<br/>
&lt;template&gt; Template &lt;/template&gt;<br/>
&lt;/category&gt;<br/>
			<br/>
The AIML category tags are case-sensitive.  Each open tag has an<br/>
associated closing tag.  This syntax obviously derives from XML.<br/>
