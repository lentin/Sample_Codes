		<template>
			<br/>
Gossip is an interesting "learning" feature of AIML.  The best way to <br/>
illustrate the gossip function is with an example.   Consider the<br/>
category with the pattern "I * " and the template:<br/>
			<br/>
Thanks for the gossip: <br/>
&lt;gossip&gt;&lt;getname/&gt; said &lt;get_gender/&gt; &lt;person2/&gt; &lt;/gossip&gt;.<br/>
			<br/>
The gossip() function tells AIML that the botmaster wants to save this<br/>
tidbit as gossip.  The &lt;get_gender/&gt; function returns "he" or "she" as<br/>
determined by the markup functions &lt;set_female&gt; and &lt;set_male/&gt;. <br/>
The &lt;person2/&gt; function converts the statement * to second person.<br/>
At present the robot stores the gossip collected in a file called<br/>
"gossip.txt".<br/>
			<br/>
&lt;gossip&gt; X &lt;/gossip&gt;  Save X as gossip.<br/>
